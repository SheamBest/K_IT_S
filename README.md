# K_IT_S

This is our joint project in which we created our own online store, KillerStyle. The division of responsibilities was as follows:

Iryna Perhun and Ulyana Perun - frontend and web design development;

Maxim Shelvakh (me) - backend and database administration.

Svyatoslav-Valentyn Hvozdyk - a team lead, involved in all development processes and helped with both front-end and back-end.
